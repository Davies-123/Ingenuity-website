        <h2>Our Teaching Approach</h2>
        <p>At Ingenuity, we make learning as accessible as possible. Wondering 
            whether you can learn from home while seating? We make that
            possible. Through our online sessions, students can learn while 
            at home. We also have physical lessons which are conductiong at our
            site. Depending on their pace, students can decide whther to have 
            one-on-one sessions or in a group with their frieds.
